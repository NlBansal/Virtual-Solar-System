# Solar System 3D Simulation

Welcome to the Solar System 3D Simulation project! This simulation provides a dynamic and interactive 3D visualization of celestial bodies within a solar system, calculating gravitational interactions and displaying real-time updates of their positions and velocities.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Simulates gravitational interactions between suns, planets, and moons.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Provides a visual representation using matplotlib.
- **Customizable Celestial Bodies**: Easily add suns, planets, and moons with specified properties.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updates positions and velocities in real-time.
