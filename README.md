# Virtual-Solar-System
Welcome to the Solar System 3D Simulation project! This project provides a dynamic and interactive 3D simulation of a solar system with customizable suns, planets, and moons. The simulation calculates gravitational interactions and updates the positions and velocities of celestial bodies in real time.
